ESP8266 WiFi Garage Door Opener from any Web Browser

There seems to be an unstoppable drive in the hacker DIY community for web based 
garage door openers and we were compelled to respond.  
The garage door opener we have opens/shuts from a push button switch that basically 
creates a short to connect two terminals on the garage door opening unit.  
That allows easy implementation because all that is required is a ESP8266 
controlled relay wired across those two terminals to create a switch closure.
